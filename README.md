Notes:
- Just try to approximate colors on embedded Google calendars. Can't seem to change foreground text color, will always be white, so it's okay to go darker with background colors. If in doubt, use one of the default calendar colors rather than customizing the color.
- Remove "/b/2" for Mac and iPhone versions.
- Calendar sizes that work for me:
    large w1550 h800
    medium w1250 h800
    small w950 h1550
